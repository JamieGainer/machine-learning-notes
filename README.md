# Machine Learning Notes

The Linear_Regression directory contains (or will soon contain)
markup files, code, and notebooks that

1.  Allow one to create random data from an underlying linear
model with Gaussian noise (the model linear regression is
essentially assuming).

2. Show how to set up a linear regression model using several
different languages and frameworks

3.  Analyze linear regression performance

The Logistic_Regression directory will be effectively identical to the
Linear_Regression directory, but for logistic regression instead of 
linear regression.
