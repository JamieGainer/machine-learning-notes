## Example 1: Disaster Tweets

This example follows the Kaggle "Getting Started with NLP" competition.
The data is labeled tweets which either do or do not describe a disaster.

I am not including the datasets (or any Kaggle datasets) in this repo.
To get the data to run the notebook
1. Make a new directory: machine-learning-notes/Case_Study_Notes/nlp-getting-started
2. Download a zip file with datasets for the competition using
```
kaggle competitions download -c nlp-getting-started
```
3. Unzip the zip file.  There should now be a train.csv and test.csv file in the machine-learning-notes/Case_Study_Notes/nlp-getting-started directory

If running the "kaggle competitions download" command doesn't work, install kaggle following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#readme)

### CountVectorizer

I have provided a brief demonstration of CountVectorizer in the notebook of that name.
This is an sklearn method that can be used to obtain (bag of word) word vectors.

### TF-IDF



### Embedding Vectors
